## Annagraha is a prototype model specially created for farmers

As we all know **Farmers** are not comfortable in GUI (Graphical User Interface) specially Indian Farmers. So we are building a VUI (Voice User Interface) Platform for farmers.

---

## 1. Language
Right now we are creating this prototype in Hindi(हिंदी) and English Language.

In future we can use many local languages and it is easy to add more languages without disturbing previous model.

## 2. Menu for a Farmer
1. Connect with Others (संपर्क करें): User can connect with Buyers, Other farmers and Transporters to make work easier for him.
2. Weather Forcast (मौसम पूर्वानुमान): Now a farmer can directly ask to our model for knowing the weather which is very necessary for a farmer.
3. Available Resources (उपलब्ध संसाधन): Farmers can directly know the various resources and equipments available in market so that a farmer can decide which tool will be helpful for him.
4. Market Rates ("मंडी का भाव"): Accurate rates of market with location.
5. Government Schemes ("सरकारी योजनाएं"): They will be able to check all the government schemes and eligibility directly through voice.
6. Contact Us ("किसान हेल्पर"): A direct help from costumer center for both skill and farming and all other things.
