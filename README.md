## Annagraha is a prototype model specially created for farmers

As we all know **Farmers** are not comfortable in GUI (Graphical User Interface) specially Indian Farmers. So we are building a VUI (Voice User Interface) Platform for farmers.

---

## 1. Language
Right now we are creating this prototype in Hindi(हिंदी) and English Language.

In future we can use many local languages and it is easy to add more languages without disturbing previous model.

## 2. Menu for a Farmer
1. Connect with Others (संपर्क करें): User can connect with Buyers, Other farmers and Transporters to make work easier for him.
2. Weather Forcast (मौसम पूर्वानुमान): Now a farmer can directly ask to our model for knowing the weather which is very necessary for a farmer.
3. Available Resources (उपलब्ध संसाधन): 
4. Market Rates ("मंडी का भाव"):
5. Government Schemes ("सरकारी योजनाएं"):
6. Contact Us ("किसान हेल्पर"):
